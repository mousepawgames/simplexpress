# SIMPLEXpress

**SIMPLEXpress** is a simple-to-use alternative to regular expressions.
Instead of requiring the user to memorize dozens of special characters with
multiple uses and complex rules, SIMPLEXpress hard-reserves two characters
and leaves the rest for literal use. Using a few simple syntactic rules,
the user can easily write powerful expressions.
